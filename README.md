# Asteroids

Asteroids is a fun recreation of the classic arcade game. You fly a spaceship, shoot asteroids, and try to avoid crashing. When you hit a big asteroid, it breaks into smaller pieces. Watch out for UFOs too!

## How to Play

Use your spaceship to shoot and destroy all the asteroids.

## Controls

*   **Up Arrow:** Move forward
*   **Left Arrow:** Turn left
*   **Right Arrow:** Turn right
*   **Spacebar:** Shoot

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   `uv` (It's assumed you already have this installed!)

### Running the Game

To run the game, simply open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

`uv` will automatically handle installing any necessary Python packages (like `pygame`) before launching the game.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues, ensure you are in the correct directory where `main.py` is located.
